  * Deployed the BoLe Network Web Application to Amazon Web Service

* Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, Data Scientist Intern, Jun 2023-Aug 2023 
  * Reduced manual search and annotation costs for lane detection datasets by identifying OOD data
  * Used SAM to acquire image segmentation outcomes and, based on artificial rules, identify images containing relatively intricate lane line structures
  * Utilized existing pretrained models to find images with false positive predicted lanes
  * Analyzed high-dimensional features to locate sparser regions in the datasets

* Tongji University Institute of Intelligent Vehicles, Research Assistant, Mar 2020–Jul 2021
  * Conducted research on defects of the standard optical model for fog and improved color performance of restored images through a newly derived model in Python, securing 3000 CNY SITP funding
  * Published the paper Traffic Intersection Re-Identification Using Monocular Camera Sensors on Sensors
  * Designed a universal framework for Lane Detection in Low Light Environment which combines the self-supervised enhancement network (Zero-DCE) with lane detection network (RESA, LSTR) and boosted the F1-measure of multiple lane detectors on the CULane dataset by 1.32%
  * Applied for the patent A Lane Detection Method based on Image Enhancement under Low Light Environment and published the paper Lane Detection under Low-illumination Condition by Enhanced Feature Learning on 2022 Intelligent and Connected Vehicles Symposium (SAE China Event Technical Papers)

* Faurecia, ECO Analysis Intern, Aug 2019–Aug 2019
  * Developed a Python program to evaluate factory logistics package solutions and provided cost-effective solutions, reducing workload from several hours to about five minutes
  * Completed route planning, price forecasting, and feasibility assessment for Milk Run in C++, reducing the cost of transportation by about 10,000 CNY a day

* TJU Racing Team, Leader of Transmission System Group/The Race Car Driver, Sep 2017–Jun 2020
  * Designed carbon fiber half axles for an FSAE car, resulting in a 10kg reduction in vehicle weight, winning the top prize at the 14th May Science and Technology Festival, and securing 10,000 CNY research funding
  * Utilized CATIA and Ansys to model and simulate the working state of TR19's chain wheel, half axles, and three-ball pins, resulting in a 100g reduction in the weight of the car
  * Contacted the sponsor and funded 1,600 CNY worth of titanium needed for the half axles
  * Won third place in the 2019 Student Formula Japan and the championship in the 2019 Formula Student China

Projects
======
